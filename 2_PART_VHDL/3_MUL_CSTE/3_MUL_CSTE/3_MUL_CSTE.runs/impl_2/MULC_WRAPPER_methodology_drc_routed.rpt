2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-9#1 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at MULTIPLIER/OUTPUT_1_reg[4]_i_1 of size 8x3, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-9#2 Warning
Small multiplier  
Detected multiplier at MULTIPLIER/OUTPUT_1_reg[7]_i_1 of size 8x3, it is implemented as LUTs due to its small size. To force the multiplier onto a DSP block, use the USE_DSP48 attribute.
Related violations: <none>
