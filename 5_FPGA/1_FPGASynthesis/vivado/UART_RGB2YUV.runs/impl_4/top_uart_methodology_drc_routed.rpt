There is a large setup violation of -3.624 ns between rcv/merger/MERGED_DATA_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and module/rgb_out_cr_reg[6]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#53 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.629 ns between rcv/merger/MERGED_DATA_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and module/rgb_out_cr_reg[5]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#54 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -3.933 ns between rcv/merger/MERGED_DATA_reg[14]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and module/rgb_out_cr_reg[7]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on nRESET relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on JTAG_RsTx relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin 
Related violations: <none>
